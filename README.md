# MachineLearningProjects

### Classification:

Choose a classification dataset from a repository such as UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle and build a classifier using scikit-learn. This could be a binary classification problem (e.g., spam detection) or a multi-class classification problem (e.g., handwritten digit recognition).

### Regression:

Choose a regression dataset from a repository such as UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle and build a regression model using scikit-learn. This could be a simple linear regression problem (e.g., predicting housing prices) or a more complex problem such as non-linear regression.

### Clustering:

Choose a dataset and apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means or DBSCAN to group the data into clusters. You could then visualize the clusters using tools such as matplotlib or seaborn.

### Dimensionality reduction:

Choose a high-dimensional dataset and apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or t-SNE to visualize the data in lower dimensions.

### Pipeline:

Build a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn that includes preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. You could demonstrate the use of cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning in the pipeline.

### Ensemble model:

Build an ensemble model using scikit-learn, such as a random forest or gradient boosting model. You could compare the performance of the ensemble model to a single model, and demonstrate how to tune the hyperparameters of the ensemble model.

### Text classification:

Choose a text classification dataset and build a classifier using scikit-learn. This could involve preprocessing the text data, such as tokenization and stemming, and using techniques such as bag-of-words or word embeddings to represent the text.

### Time series forecasting:

Choose a time series dataset and build a model to forecast future values. This could involve using techniques such as decomposition, smoothing, or autoregression to model the time series data.

### Anomaly detection:

Choose a dataset and build a model to detect anomalies in the data. This could be a binary classification problem (e.g., fraud detection) or a multi-class classification problem (e.g., identifying different types of anomalies).

### Sentiment analysis:

Choose a dataset of text data with associated labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and build a classifier to predict the sentiment of new text data. This could involve preprocessing the text data and using techniques such as bag-of-words or word embeddings to represent the text.

### Recommender system:

Build a recommender system using scikit-learn to recommend items to users based on their past history or ratings. This could involve using techniques such as collaborative filtering or matrix factorization to make recommendations.
